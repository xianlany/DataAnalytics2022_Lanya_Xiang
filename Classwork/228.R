# We use the subset option in the lm() function to fit a linear regression using,
# only the observations corresponding to the training set.
lm.fit <- lm(mpg~horsepower, data = Auto, subset = train)
# Now we use predict() function to estimate the response for all 392 observations,
# and we use the mean() function to calculate the MSE of the 196 observations in the
# validation set. Note that the -train selects only the observations that are not in,
# the training set.

mean((mpg-predict(lm.fit,Auto))[-train]^2)
# Therefore, the estimated test MSE for the linear regression fit is 26.14

# We can use the poly() function to estimate test error for the quadratic and cubic regression.

lm.fit2 <- lm(mpg~poly(horsepower,2), data = Auto, subset = train) # Quadratic

# Cubic regression line
lm.fit3 <- lm(mpg~poly(horsepower,3), data = Auto, subset = train) # Cubic
mean((mpg-predict(lm.fit3,Auto))[-train]^2)
# The error rates are: 19.82 for quadratics and 19.78 for cubic
# If we choose different training set instead, then we will obtain somewhat different errors,
# on the validation set.

lm.fit2 <- lm(mpg~poly(horsepower,2), data = Auto, subset = train) # Quadratic
mean((mpg-predict(lm.fit2,Auto))[-train]^2)
# the error rate is 18.90
lm.fit3 <- lm(mpg~poly(horsepower,3), data = Auto, subset = train) # Cubic
mean((mpg-predict(lm.fit3,Auto))[-train]^2)
# the error rate is 19.25
# Using this split of the observations into a training set and validation set,
# we find that the validation set error rates for the models with linear, quadratic,
# and cubic terms are 23.29, 18.90 and 19.25 respectively.
# The model that predict mpg using a quadratic function of horsepower performs better,
# than a models that only involves only a linear function of horsepower, and there is a,
# little evidence in favor of a model that uses a cubic function of horsepower.
